This project is a web-based game inspired by the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors, enhanced with two additional options: Lizard and Spock. Players can choose one of the five options, and the computer randomly selects its choice. The game determines the winner based on the rules:

- Rock crushes Scissors
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors
- Scissors decapitates Lizard
- Lizard eats Paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes Rock

The primary goal is to entertain users with an interactive game that tests their luck and decision-making skills.
